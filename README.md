## Stock-Price Analyzer

---

Stock-prica analyzer Angular front-end application.

This is an application that perform simple predictions over companies stock-price data.
I lost the code I wrote to create the ML model which perform the predictions, but here's the main [source](https://www.askpython.com/python/examples/stock-price-prediction-python) I used to build the model.

It was planned to predict **future prices**, but after some research I figured out that it isn't feasible for the nature of stock-price data. I've found that there's other kind of **algorithms** that provide more accurate predictions, but **none of them** proved to be reliable enough.

It was also to implement **CRUD** operations to manage a **stock-price database**, enabling custom **insights**, **analytics**... but as I said before, trying to predict stock-price doesn't seem to be possible for a non professional in the **field**.
